 <h1 class="heading">ABOUT ME</h1>

 <p class="para">
    Hello, my name is Akash Varma Mantena, and red is my favourite colour.
    I'm a 20-year-old computer science student that enjoys creating interactive websites and mobile applications.
 </p>
 <p class="para">It all started in mid-2020 with a UI/UX competition hosted by one of our university's clubs. They taught us the fundamentals of Figma, which I found fascinating and quickly became addicted to. I learned about prototyping and many other amazing things through watching innumerable figma-related YouTube videos. I began entering any UI/UX design competition I came across. Then I became engrossed in my college work.</p>
<p class="paraa">After learning about frontend web programming through UI design, I grew interested in it. I get lost in my own small imagined universe, full with flashing idea lights, when I'm designing or constructing a website. Then, because my brother insisted on assisting him with his project, I decided to try my hand at mobile application development. Software programming excites me because it allows me to see my imagined design in action.</p>
